# sasqlite

This directory previously contained an `s3db`-backed SQLite virtual table implementation (plus a loadable
extension in `sqlitefun/sasqlite/loadable`). It relied on the older `github.com/jrhy/s3db` API and CRDT
interfaces that have since moved/changed.

Status: deprecated/parked. The code remains for historical reference and is not maintained after `s3db` API changes.
